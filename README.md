# ReadCleanData_final_project

This repository contains 4 different files:
1. cleaning_code.R is the R script which I used to clean the data an extract the tidy dataset.
2. clean_data.txt is the clean dataset displaying the test and train sets for the desired features.
3. clean_data_mean.txt is the second dataset containing the mean value of each feature for each combination of subject and activity.
