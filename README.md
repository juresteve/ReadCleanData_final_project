# ReadCleanData_final_project

This repository contains 4 different files:
1. run_analysis.R is the R script which I used to clean the data an extract the tidy dataset.
2. clean_data.txt is the clean dataset displaying the test and train sets for the desired features.
3. clean_data_mean.txt is the second dataset containing the mean value of each feature for each combination of subject and activity.
4. CodeBook.md is the code book containing the different variables used and the process followed in order to arrive to the clean data set.
